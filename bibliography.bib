  abstract     = {Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained. LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability. LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]},

	abstract =	{The application-specific routing requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks (U-LLNs) are presented in this document. In the near future, sensing and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban environments so as to improve people&#39;s living conditions as well as to monitor compliance with increasingly strict environmental laws. These field nodes are expected to measure and report a wide gamut of data (for example, the data required by applications that perform smart-metering or that monitor meteorological, pollution, and allergy conditions). The majority of these nodes are expected to communicate wirelessly over a variety of links such as IEEE 802.15.4, low-power IEEE 802.11, or IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), which given the limited radio range and the large number of nodes requires the use of suitable routing protocols. The design of such protocols will be mainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory, processing power, battery, etc.) and the particularities of the outdoor urban application scenarios. As such, for a wireless solution for Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL) networks to be useful, the protocol(s) ought to be energy-efficient, scalable, and autonomous. This documents aims to specify a set of IPv6 routing requirements reflecting these and further U-LLNs&#39; tailored characteristics. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},

    Abstract = {RPL is a distance-vector routing protocol designed by the ROLL Working Group in order to cater to the specific needs of low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). It is specified in the standards document RFC 6550 and is the emerging standard for routing in Wireless Sensor Networks. RPL has been widely criticized for a number of reasons, including underspecification and complexity of implementation. This thesis analyzes the RPL routing standard with regards to specification, performance, comparison with other routing standards, open source and industrial implementations, as well as improvement efforts. It also proposes an alternative to the RPL routing standard, RPL-Lite, that overcomes the shortcomings of the RPL design. RPL-Lite reduces the feature set by including only the most necessary features required for routing. By doing so, it reduces the implementation complexity and makes it more suitable for deployment on resource constrained nodes.}
